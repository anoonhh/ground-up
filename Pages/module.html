          <h2>Bridging the Triad of Therapist, Client and Medicine</h2>
          <p class="pt-4">
            Modile 1 supports therapist to guide clients deeply into their felt experience, both in Psychotherapy and Non ordinary experiences, as the pathway to deeper, more fundamental insights and subsequent change.
          </p>
          <p>The scope of module 1 is primarily on the preparation and integration of clients engaging in Psychedelic medicines.</p>
          <p>The macro learning outcome is the realigning of psychotherapeutic approach to match and support the Characteristics of the psychedelic experience; thus reorienting Mental Health practitioners from a top down (thinking) orientation to a bottom up (felt) orientation.</p>
          <p>In bridging the triad of Therapist Client and Medicine the learner will navigate 2 key directions</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="mb-2">Learning and applying psychotherapeutic skills, approaches, frameworks and lenses that support clients to engage via a bottom up, feeling orientation whilst staying in direct relationship with their own experience and the therapist.</li>
            <li>To support the therapist themselves to become more Felt lead, Bottom up and in relationship with themselves and their clients.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Aligning approach to medicine powerfully supports clients to better assimilate their non ordinary experiences into integrated wholes at the cognitive, somatic relational and spiritual level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being problem focused, cognitive, analytical and “client lead” are important and useful approaches in conventional Psychotherapy, although these largely Top-down approaches are insufficient when guiding clients through many or most forms of Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy.
          </p>
          <p>Learning outcomes to the macro phenomenological movements which Psychedelic Experiences induce. </p>
